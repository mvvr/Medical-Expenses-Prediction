* The Expenses of Smokers in all regions ranges from 20 to 60k
* Whereas the Expenses of Non Smokers in all regions ranges from 10 to 20K
* The Lesser range of Expense is for lesser age people and vice versa.

* We can clearly see that there is a increasing pattern for BMI as well.
* For smoker with less BMI: Expense is around 20k
* For Smokers with High BMI: Expense is around 50K
* For Non Smokers BMI is not a Huge Factor, The Expense range from 5k to 10k

* This Chart makes it clear that BMI is not powerful indicator Expenses, as people having less BMI also have high Medical Expenses.
* This chart makes it clear that People who smoke have higher Medical Expenses.
* The Size of Bubble, which represents age, shows that people having higher expenses belong to Higher Expenses category

* This Chart clearly depits that the Southeast region has higher expenses compared to other regions.
* This Chart clearly shows that Males have Higher Expenses in general in all the regions.

### Comparison of Models
